**Airbnb Analysis Project**

## Project Title
Airbnb Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data in the travel industry and property management sector using Python, MongoDB Atlas, and Power BI. Data analysis will be performed in Google Colab, and the final insights and visualizations will be presented in Power BI.

## Skills Developed
- Python scripting
- Data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- MongoDB Atlas usage
- Power BI for creating dashboards

## Problem Statement
The project objectives include:
1. Establish a MongoDB connection, and retrieve the Airbnb dataset efficiently.
2. Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for data integrity.
3. Analyze pricing variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
4. Analyze availability patterns across seasons and visualize occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.
5. Investigate location-based insights.
6. Create interactive visualizations for user exploration.
7. Build a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to present key insights.

## Approach
1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**: Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas, retrieve the dataset, and perform queries to extract the required information.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for data integrity.
3. **Price Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize pricing variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
4. **Availability Analysis by Season**: Analyze Airbnb availability patterns with visualizations of occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.
5. **Location-Based Insights**: Extract and visualize location-based data insights.
6. **Interactive Visualizations**: Develop dynamic visualizations for user interaction.
7. **Dashboard Creation with Power BI**: Create a comprehensive dashboard with Power BI containing various visualizations.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Store the dataset and any related data files.
- `powerbi/`: Power BI files for creating the final dashboard.
- `README.md`: Project overview, instructions, and documentation.

## How to Access the Power BI Dashboard
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Open the provided Power BI file (`powerbi/airbnb_analysis.pbix`).
3. Customize and refresh the data source if necessary.
4. Interact with the dashboard to explore the insights.
